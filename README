Hello Welcome to Cocktail Delight. A place where you can keep track of all you cocktails and their ingredients. To start you would want to run rails s in your terminal while in the cocktail_backend. This way all the data from the api will be good to go. Afterwards you can either run LiveServer on index.html file or simply open it in the browser. From there you are all set to go! You can now View, Add or Delete from your avialable cocktails. Enjoy!
